# Discretizer Example

This example is demoing both the `FieldDiscretizer` and `DiscreteFieldGrapher` classes from the `mivp_agent.aquaticus.field` module. Descretization for state is useful in many forms of ML.

![Demo](../../assets/DiscretizerDemo.gif)

Running the `DiscreteFieldGrapher` will slow down the program and is intended mainly for debugging. 

# Running

Like the pLearn example, you will need to run the simulation separately.

```
cd examples/DiscreteField/mission
./launch_full.sh
```

```
cd examples/DiscreteField
./run.py
```
